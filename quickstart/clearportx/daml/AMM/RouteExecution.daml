  PHASE 3: MULTI-HOP ROUTING

  Enables swaps across multiple pools atomically.
  Example: ETH → USDC → DAI (2 hops)

  Architecture:
  - Off-ledger: Client finds best route using PoolAnnouncements
  - On-ledger: Execute swaps sequentially through existing SwapRequest
  - Slippage: Only check final output (intermediate steps use minOutput=0)

  Note: This is a simplified multi-hop that chains SwapRequests.
  Each hop creates a SwapRequest → PrepareSwap → ExecuteSwap.
