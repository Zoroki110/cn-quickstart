# Pool Creation Verification Summary

## What Happened

1. **Pool Creation Script Output**: The DAML script reported success:
   ```
   [DA.Internal.Prelude:555]: "Creating parties with suffix: 2025-10-25"
   [DA.Internal.Prelude:555]: "Creating ETH token..."
   [DA.Internal.Prelude:555]: "Creating USDC token..."
   [DA.Internal.Prelude:555]: "Creating pool..."
   [DA.Internal.Prelude:555]: "Pool created successfully!"
   ```

2. **Party Creation Issue**: 
   - The script used `allocateParty` which creates NEW parties with random suffixes
   - These are NOT the same as the FRESH_* parties we created with grpcurl
   - We can see parties like `OP_2025-10-25-d4d95138`, `POOL_2025-10-25-9b3970be` exist
   - But querying these parties shows 0 contracts

## Possible Explanations

1. **Script Mode**: The DAML script might have run in "test" mode without actually committing to the ledger
2. **Wrong Participant**: The script might have connected to a different participant/ledger
3. **Visibility**: The contracts might exist but not be visible to the parties we're querying

## How to Verify Pool Creation

### Option 1: Check Backend API
The backend returns `[]` (empty array) which confirms no pools are visible without authentication.

### Option 2: Direct Ledger Query
We queried all known parties and found 0 contracts visible.

### Option 3: Transaction History
We could check the transaction stream but it appears empty.

## Conclusion

**The pool was likely NOT actually created on the ledger**, despite the success message. The DAML script execution might have been in a test/dry-run mode.

## Next Steps

To actually create a pool that we can verify:
1. Use the Canton Console directly (most reliable)
2. Use a DAML script with explicit participant configuration
3. Use the backend API with proper JWT authentication
