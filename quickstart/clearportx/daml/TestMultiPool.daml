  MULTI-POOL ARCHITECTURE TESTS (Phase 2)

  Tests:
  1. testCreateMultiplePools - Create ETH-USDC, USDC-DAI, ETH-DAI pools
  2. testPoolDiscovery - Query announcements to find pools
  3. testCompetingPools - Multiple operators, same token pair
  4. testPoolAnnouncements - Verify announcements are immutable
  5. testSwapAcrossPools - Use different pools for different swaps
